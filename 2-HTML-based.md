## 1️⃣ What are Semantic Tags?

I would say:  
"Semantic tags are HTML tags that clearly describe their meaning to the browser and the developer.  
Examples are: <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <nav>.  
These tags make the structure more readable, improve SEO, and help screen readers understand the page better."

## 2️⃣ Why are Semantic Tags important?

I would say:  
"They make the HTML structure clean and meaningful, which helps in accessibility, SEO, and easier maintenance.  
Search engines also understand the content better when semantic tags are used."

---

## 3️⃣ What are Forms in HTML?

I would say:  
"A form is used to collect user input.  
It is created using the <form> tag and inside it we can have inputs like text fields, email, password, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and submit buttons.  
Forms send data to the server using GET or POST methods."

---

## 4️⃣ What are different input types?

I would say:  
"There are many input types like text, email, password, number, file, checkbox, radio, date, time, and range.  
Each input type helps in collecting specific data in the correct format."

---

## 5️⃣ How do you do Validation in HTML?

I would say:  
"HTML has built-in validation.  
We can use attributes like required, minlength, maxlength, pattern, type='email', type='number'.  
These help to ensure the user enters the correct data before submitting the form.  
We can also apply custom validation using JavaScript."

---

## 6️⃣ What is LocalStorage?

I would say:  
"LocalStorage is a browser storage that stores data permanently until we manually delete it.  
The data remains even after closing or refreshing the browser.  
It stores key–value pairs and has around 5MB storage limit."

---

## 7️⃣ What is SessionStorage?

I would say:  
"SessionStorage is similar to LocalStorage, but the data is removed automatically when the browser tab is closed.  
It is used for temporary data for a single session only."

---

## 8️⃣ LocalStorage vs SessionStorage?

I would say:  
"LocalStorage → data stays permanently  
SessionStorage → data stays only until the tab is closed  
Both store data in key-value format and support around 5MB."

---

## 9️⃣ What are Meta Tags?

I would say:  
"Meta tags provide information about the webpage to the browser and search engines.  
Common meta tags are viewport, description, keywords, charset.  
They help with SEO, responsiveness, and page information."

---

## 🔟 What is SEO in HTML?

I would say:  
"SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization.  
In HTML, we improve SEO by using correct semantic tags, meta description, header hierarchy (H1, H2, H3), alt text for images, and clean structure.  
This helps search engines understand the content and rank the website better."

---

## ⭐ BONUS: If interviewer asks “How do you make a website SEO friendly?”

I would say:  
"I use semantic tags, proper headings, meaningful URLs, alt attributes for images, mobile-friendly layout, fast loading, and proper meta tags like description and keywords."

## what is redux

Redux is a state management libraary thar provide a centralized store where shared state of application is stored

## what do we need it

We need it manage shared state in application
As many component need the same data,passing through prop become complex and hard to manage
Redux provide centralized store, so each component can directly access and update the state

## what problem it solve
Redux solves the problem of prop drilling
when we pass the data through multiple level even they dont need it

What is the flow of Redux?

Redux follows a one-way data flow.
First, a user action happens, like clicking a button.
That action is sent as an Action object.
The action is handled by a Reducer, which decides how the state should change.
The reducer updates the Store with the new state.
The updated state is then sent to the UI, and the component re-renders.


## what is action

Action is a object that tell reducer the reducer what kind of change should happen.
It contain type property mandatory and payload is optional

What is a reducer?
A reducer is a function that decides how the state should change based on an action
It takes the current state and an action as input and returns a new updated state.
Reducers do not modify the existing state directly; they always return a new state

What is the Redux store?

The Redux store is a central place where the entire application state is stored.
It holds the current state, allows actions to be dispatched, and uses reducers to update the state.

What is useSelector()?

useSelector() is a React-Redux hook used to read data from the Redux store.

9️⃣ What is useDispatch()?

useDispatch() is a React-Redux hook used to send actions to the Redux store.
When an action is dispatched, it is handled by the reducer, and the store gets updated.

What is Redux Toolkit (RTK)?

Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic.
It reduces boilerplate code and makes Redux easier and faster to use.
RTK provides built-in tools like configureStore, createSlice, and createAsyncThunk.

what is createSlice()

createSlice() is a function provided by Redux Toolkit to create a Redux slice easily.
It combines initial state, reducers, and action creators in one place.


What is createAsyncThunk()?
createAsyncThunk() is a function in Redux Toolkit used to handle asynchronous operations like API calls.
